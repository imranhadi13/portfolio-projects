Titanic Survivorship 

Goal: To explore data from Titanic disaster, and predict the survivorship of test dataset with machine learning model.

Code: 
[Titanic](https://github.com/imranhadi13/portfolio-projects/blob/a799c0213d351f862931522f5746fedc32424d29/Python%20projects/Malaysian%20Flood/MalaysianFlood.ipynb)

Description: 
The train dataset included information regarding the passengers of Titanic with the outcome variable of survived or not. The test dataset included similar features in train dataset, minus the feature on 'survived'. The dataset is part of Kaggle competition's 'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster'

Skills: exploratory data analysis, data visualization, machine learning model

Technology: Python

Raw dataset: 
[Titanic Train set](https://github.com/imranhadi13/portfolio-projects/blob/a799c0213d351f862931522f5746fedc32424d29/Python%20projects/Malaysian%20Flood/MalaysianFlood.ipynb)
