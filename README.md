# Welcome to my projects!

Hi, my name is Muhammad Imran. I am a data analyst, with previous background in healthcare and medical insurance claims. 
I have always been fascinated with looking into like big set of puzzle and piecing the pieces together to find the story behind them. 

I have completed my course for Google Data Analytics and Google Advanced Data Analytics certification, and have also completed Microsoft Power BI courses to prepare for the field of data analytics. 
I have been trained on the following skills:
- Excel 
- SQL
- Power BI
- Tableau
- Python
